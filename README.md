# Advanced-Search-Algorithms

We implemented sophihsticated search techniques like BFS, DFS, Uniform Cost search, A* to solve the Peg Solitaire problem. The problem deals with a board game called peg solitaire where we have a number of pegs on a boad. Subject to certain rules our aim is to move from a given start configuration of the board to a certain goal configuration.

The search algorithms used various heuristics to better estimate the feasible paths and thus cut down on the search space reducing computaion time and resource.
